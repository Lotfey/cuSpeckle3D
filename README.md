# cuSpeckle3D speckle generator

The project focuses mainly on developing a 3-dimensional speckle volume gen-
erator based on the Boolean Model presented in [1] with CUDA for parallel im-
plementation and C++. The results are satisfactory and accurate according to 
profesor F. Sur himself

Here is an example of a dense speckle image 500x500 generated by cuspeckle3D:

Another example of a speckle image 500x500 with less speckle presence

The final example is 3D volume speckle of a size of 101x101x2000, the figure shows the volume cuts in 
the tree plans X-Y, X-Z and Y-Z plans
